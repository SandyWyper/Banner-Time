## Submitting issues and improvements

I am still very inexperienced in gitHub and open source projects, so any advice is very welcome. This applies to workflow/procedure as well as the code itself.

Keen for people to open pull requests if you feel the code base should be changed, or if you build a new feature. Please explain what your changes are and why they benefit the project.

#### Test case required

**All bug reports, problem issues and new features require a CodePen**.

[Please fork this CodePen as a baseline](https://codepen.io/SandyWyper/pen/pooqWyZ).

- A test case clearly demonstrates the bug or issue.
- It contains the bare minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to demonstrate the bug.
- Assets are not minified (we cannot debug .min.js files).

Providing a test case is the best way to get your issue addressed. Without a test case; your issue may be closed.  
You must provide a clear and simple way to reproduce the issue with the provided fiddle.

## Support

This thing aught to be fairly sturdy. But if you encounter any issues, then well, you're on your own! Ha, perhaps I should set up a forum or something ...?

## Feature Requests

Got an idea of a good feature? Let me know.
